              Thomas finds projects that deal with fundamental parts of our
              daily life particularly interesting. How do we keep traditional
              values when we transition into the virtual world? A digital
              experience should deliver the same sense of meaning we already
              know and understand.

              Latch was designed with trust, longevity and mindfulness as
              guiding values. The aim was to create a system that is so simple
              to understand that anyone, anywhere in the world, is able to take
              part in the essential exchange of access and servicesâ€”enabling
              seamless interaction between the many participants and services
              that is part of our modern village.

              "When you aim to create a simple, universal and human experience,
              you need to lead with humanistic values, not digital complexity,"

              privacy limitations so users can connect on a personal level.

              The Latch lens is perhaps the core invention of the Latch
              ecosystem. All Latch products share this same simple interface.
              It's inviting and easy to understand. Billed by The New York Times
              as the "the unblinking eye". Its simple design a key to Latch
              success.
